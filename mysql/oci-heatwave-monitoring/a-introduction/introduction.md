# Introduction

## About this Workshop

 In this workshop there are three lab exercises. They have been organized to help you become familiar with the use of this service's key capabilities: performing common Database Management tasks using the Oracle Cloud. In this lab, we have simulated HeatWave MySQL databases so you do not have to setup or use one of your cloud account databases. Additionally, the workshop covers the utilization of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Database Management to monitor the MySQL HeatWave database, Ops Insights for capacity planning & SQL Insights and Logging Analytics for application logs.


Estimated Time: 60 minutes

*MySQL Heatwave Database*

MySQL Heatwave is a fully-managed database service, powered by the integrated HeatWave in-memory query accelerator. It is the only cloud-native database service that combines transactions, analytics, and machine learning services into MySQL Heatwave, delivering real-time, secure analytics without the complexity, latency, and cost of ETL duplication.

*Observability and Management Services*

Monitor, analyze, and manage multicloud applications and infrastructure environments with full-stack visibility, prebuilt analytics, and automation using Oracle Cloud Observability and Management Platform.

- Database Management

    Database management provides unified console for cloud and on-premises databases with lifecycle database management capabilities for monitoring, performance management, tuning, and administration. With Performance Hub, developers can improve SQL code during active development as well as continuously monitor and tune queries running on production systems.

- Ops Insights

    OCI Ops Insights, (OPSI) service, part of the Oracle Cloud Observability and Management platform, is a cloud native-solution that helps gather, analyze telemetry data from various resources, and plan for enterprise growth. It helps perform data-driven capacity planning and performance management, thereby reducing enterprise capital expenditure and improving application throughput. This new HeatWave MySQL DB system support in the Ops Insights service brings the best of ML-based resource usage trending and capacity planning, Data Explorer based performance analysis, and dashboard capabilities into Oracle Cloud. For more information on Ops Insights for HeatWave MySQL please refer to Ops Insights > **[Use Ops Insights for HeatWave MySQL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/operations-insights/doc/mysql-insights.html)**.

- Logging Analytics

    Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Logging Analytics lets you index, enrich, aggregate, explore, search, analyze, correlate, visualize and monitor all log data from your applications and system infrastructure on cloud or on-premises. Oracle Logging Analytics provides a one-click end-to-end Kubernetes monitoring solution for the underlying infrastructure, Kubernetes platform and cloud native applications. For more information on Logging Analytics and log Explorer please refer to Observability and Management > **[Use Logging Analytics to monitor Kubernetes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/kubernetes-oke-logging-analytics/index.html)**.


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Use Database Management to monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of HeatWave MySQL and review query performances
* Use Ops Insights for capacity planning and SQL Insights
* Use Logging analytics to analyze Kubernetes logs
