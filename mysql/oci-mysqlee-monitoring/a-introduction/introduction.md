# Introduction

## About this Workshop

 This workshop consists of three lab exercises organized to familiarize you with key capabilities of Oracle Cloud services, including Database Management, Ops Insights and Logging Analytics. We have simulated External MySQL databases, so you don't need to set up or use one from your cloud account.

 You'll learn how to:
 * Use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Database Management to monitor the External MySQL databases
 * Use Ops Insights for capacity planning and SQL Insights
 * Use Logging Analytics to collect and analyze application logs

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

**Observability and Management Services**

Oracle Cloud **Observability and Management Platform** provides full-stack visibility, prebuilt analytics, and automation to monitor, analyze, and manage multicloud applications and infrastructure environments.

- Database Management

    Database management provides a unified console for cloud and on-premises databases, with lifecycle database management capabilities for monitoring, performance management, tuning, and administration. With Performance Hub, developers can improve SQL code during active development and continuously monitor and tune queries in production.

- Ops Insights

    OCI Ops Insights (OPSI) is a cloud native-solution that gathers and analyzes telemetry data, helping enterprises plan for growth. It helps perform data-driven capacity planning and performance management, thereby reducing enterprise capital expenditure and improving application throughput. It supports ML-based resource usage trending, capacity planning, and Data Explorer-based performance analysis, and all within an intuitive dashboard.

- Logging Analytics

    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Logging Analytics is a cloud solution that lets you index, enrich, aggregate, explore, search, analyze, correlate, visualize and monitor all log data from your applications and system infrastructure on cloud or on-premises. It can extract database instance records based on the SQL query that you provide in the log source configuration. In this lab learn how to use the Oracle Cloud Logging Analytics service to enrich the log data collected from the world's most popular open source database - MySQL.
